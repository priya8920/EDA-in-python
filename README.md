# EDA With Python
Exploratory Data Analysis of Melbourne Housing data

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis ?

Understand by example : you have to order best food for your family from the varieties of the restaurants available in your area or city
                        you will order by swiggy, zomato or any other food ordering platform.

                        So what you have done prior to ordering the food is called as Exploratory Data Analysis in a Data Scienctists language.
                        Bravo!! you got it!
                        
Defination           :  An EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) is a process or technique to gather some meaningful insights of the data and various aspects from the data ,so that                               various operations can be performed on the data seamlessly.
                        
## What is the purpose/objective of Exploratory Data Analysis?
-> It is basically used to filter/clean the data from the redundancies(null values/missing values/duplicate values).
-> To identify the independent and dependent variables in the dataset .
-> To identify the correlations between the variables.
-> To detect the outliers

## Steps involved in EDA:
1. Description of data.
2. Handling missing values, duplicates values.
3. Handling outliers.
4. Understanding relationships and insights through plots
